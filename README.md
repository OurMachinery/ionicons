# The Machinery Icon Font

This project holds the icon font used by The Machinery to draw icons. It is installed in the
`data/fonts` directory when The Machinery is built.

Most of the icons in this front are from [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) v5.0.1. Ionicons
is licensed under MIT.

The `ionicons.json` glyph map and the TTF file are from
https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons. This project is also licensed under MIT.

In addition, this project also contains some custom icons in the `the-machinery-add-ons` folder. We
license out these icons and the result TTF file under MIT.
